# MedicationSmarespace

Our Smart Space is designed to organize medications by category and type order.

In this way, the smart space will resemble the arrangement of medications in drawers like in the pharmacy.
The X-axis represents different categories of medications,
the Y-axis represents a typical order of the medications, according to the first letter in the name of the medication.

Three types of players can perform actions on the system.

Use the RESTful API to perform operations on the system.

Use JUnit to the tests.
